# DSA

Welcome to **DSA** ‚Äî a growing collection of Data Structures & Algorithms solutions, primarily for coding interview prep and competitive programming.  
Maintained by [Mradul-Lakhotiya](https://github.com/Mradul-Lakhotiya).

## üìö Overview

This repository contains solved coding problems (especially from LeetCode) with clear explanations and organized folder structure.  
It‚Äôs designed to help you learn, practice, and master essential algorithms and data structures.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Organization

- Each folder corresponds to a coding problem, named using the format:  
  `problem-number-problem-name`  
  _(e.g., `0011-container-with-most-water`)_
- Inside each folder:
  - `README.md` ‚Äî Problem statement, examples, constraints
  - Solution files (Python, Java, C++, etc.)

## ‚ú® Example Problems

- [Container With Most Water](./0011-container-with-most-water/README.md)
- [Longest Common Prefix](./0014-longest-common-prefix/README.md)
- [3Sum](./0015-3sum/README.md)
- ...and more added regularly!

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Browse folders** for problems you want to study or solve.
2. **Read the README.md** inside each problem folder for the statement and sample cases.
3. **Check solution files** for approaches and code.
4. **Clone the repository** to run or test solutions locally.
